> It was super cool. It was ideal that the example was very simple, 
> where there was no chance for anyone to lack knowledge. 
> It nicely showed how you can go from the general to a high level of granularity, 
> and that in a seemingly banal example, where you would think what else is there to talk about. 
> It turns out that you can take every little piece and zoom in. 
> It was cool that we reproduced it in the realities of our organization, 
> that is on Miro, because that's what we will be using 99% of the time.

> Valuable knowledge, which is good to assimilate before conducting event storming in a team. 
> The training was accessible - theoretical knowledge along with practical use. 
> I had no previous contact with event storming, 
> so a big plus was the choice of example - instead of a specific application or its single functionality, 
> it was simply the process of software development in a given team. 
> Thanks to this, there was no additional burden in the form of domain knowledge of a given project, 
> and it was possible to focus on the approach itself and the individual stages of event storming.
